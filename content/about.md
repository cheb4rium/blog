Am I a monkey? Am I a bear?

There is not much I'd like to share.

I'll fill this out as I go.



# Reasons for this blog

I'm pretty bad an public speaking and presenting. When I tell stories I tend to jump around, interrupting my flow, which can be frustrating for the listener. So, to get my thoughts in order and practice laying out my ideas in a sequence, I'm keeping this blog.

# Who am I?

I'm a software developer / solutions engineer / startup entrepreneur.
